# logging-with-winston

Configuring Winston with a server with File and MongoDB transports

Run `node app.js` to start the server and access the following URLs to trigger server responses and requests.

`http://localhost:3000/`
`http://localhost:3000/calc`
`http://localhost:3000/hello`

Logs will be recorded into the server.log file. Open `server.log` to view the recorded logs.

Any error logs will also be recorded in a MongoDB database.
